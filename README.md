#Awesome WordPress Developer Tips
> Curated list that contain very awesome and ready code, snippets or examples without libraries or external packages made it for developers.

##Why
This list is born from a real workflow in my development in WordPress, sometimes you don't need or not exist a library that do a specific stuff very well with a real case to study.  
When i need something like that I search for other plugins that do that stuff to study and replicate, better if possible. For that reason I remember many plugins what they do and I search for recreate the same UX/UI. This list infact contain reference to plugins or docs but not to tutorials.  
In this way is possible see in action, also the workaround used, and more important a case study.  
In few words this is a list for skilled WordPress developers that want a simple way to found specific code (in the mainly case how use a specific hook).  

PS: Part * is used because sometimes the code is splitted (maybe an hook declaration and a function).  
PSS: Sometimes the code can be in the wrong line because the line is changed, search in the linked page or open a ticket to fix that list.
